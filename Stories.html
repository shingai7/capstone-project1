        <p>The events of the day highlight a few individuals who took part in the protest. Among the first children killed was 15-year-old Hastings Ndlovu, and 12-year-old Hector Pieterson. We also remember Tsietsi Mashinini, who lead the students in protest.</p>

        <h3>Hector Pieterson</h3>
        <p>Hector was one of the first victims of the uprising in 1976. Despite police claims that he was killed by a bullet "ricocheting off the ground," he was killed by a shot fired straight at him. Pieterson was taken to a local clinic and pronounced dead. He was 12 years old when he died.

            On June 16, 2002, the Hector Pieterson Memorial and Museum opened in Soweto, close where he was shot in Orlando West. This was done in memory of Hector and those who died during the 1976 uprising across the nation.</p><br>

        <h3>Hastings Ndlovu</h3>
        <p>Although media accounts identified Hector as the first child to die on June 16, 1976, police records show that Hastings Ndlovu was the first child to be shot. Ndlovu's death was not as well-known as Hector's because no photographer was present to capture it, and his name was not instantly known.</p><br>

        <h3>Tebogo 'Tsietsi' Mashini</h3>
        <p>Tsietsi Mashinini was born on 27 January 1957 in Central Western Jabavu, Soweto. Mashinini became a historic icon for his contribution to student politics that led to the protests of 16 June 1976. On 13th June 1976, about 500 Soweto students met at the Orlando Donaldson Community Hall to discuss ways and means of confronting and challenging the Department of Bantu Education.

            At the time that the peaceful march was agreed upon, Mashinini was the president of Soweto Students Representative Council (SSRC).

            The horrific events of 16 June resulted in Mashinini becoming the most wanted man in the country. The police offered a R500 reward for anyone with information that would lead to his arrest. In August 1976, Mashinini left South Africa for Botswana and later proceeded to the West Coast of Africa. He finally settled in Liberia, where he passed away in 1990.</p>
