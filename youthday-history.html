    <p>
        On the morning of June 16, 1976, thousands of black pupils from Soweto, then in the Transvaal, now in Gauteng, marched from their schools to Orlando Stadium.

When the Bantu Education Act (1953) was implemented, black students were already mobilized by student organizations and the Black Consciousness Movement to protest an official order that made Afrikaans - alongside English only - as the medium of instruction compulsory in black township schools across the country. The use of African languages was prohibited in these institutions, and the Constitution supported the designation of Afrikaans and English as the country's official languages.


The gathering was a peaceful protest to persuade the government not to make Afrikaans mandatory in schools.


When armed cops arrived to disperse the crowds with dogs, tear gas, and bullets, they started fire on the students. The demonstration turned into a student uprising against the apartheid government, but police killed hundreds of students. As a result, the so-called <a href="https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/june-16-soweto-youth-uprising">1976 student uprising</a> was created.

    <p>Although the protests of 16 June 1976 resulted in a number of casualties, the youth of 1976 played a role in fighting and overcoming the inequality and oppression caused by apartheid.

        Following the 1976 uprisings, many young people left South Africa, crossing the border into the frontline states to join the liberation movement in exile.

        Today, 16 June is a South African public holiday. There are Youth Day celebrations that are held country-wide in order to empower all South Africans and to remember those who lost their lives.</p> <br><br>
